# APIs and data collection in Python

## Introduction

This is a learning git repository for the course **Python Basics for Data Science** provided by edX.

### Coin Gecko API

This example utilizes **pycoingecko** to retrive bitcoin data. Uses **pandas** to create a DataFrame instance, formats the Unix TimeStamp and Price at that time of the DataFrame, converts TimeStamp into readable time units, and group the data to find min, max, high, and low price of the day. Lastly, **plotly** helps to generate a candlestick plot for the DataFrame and creates an HTML file contains the plot.

Note:

- Need to be more familiar with how to manipulate data using **pandas** and **DataFrame** instances.
- Need to be more familiar with different kinds of plots/graphs and when to use them.
- For now focuses more on being familiar with these libraries rather than actually analyzing the data?
